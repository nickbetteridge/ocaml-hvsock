open Lwt.Infix

(* Workarounds:
   1. select() is not implemented so we can't use regular non-blocking I/O
      i.e. we must use first class threads. Note that Lwt_Fn calls
      can block if the thread pool fills up. We create our own threads per
      connection to avoid this.
   2. connect() blocks forever instead of failing with ECONNREFUSED if the
      server is down when the client calls connect. We declare a 1s timeout
      and raise ECONNREFUSED ourselves.
